# System Design

This application will collect daily updates from company personnel and generate high-level summaries with the ability to drill down into specific details.

## Solution Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:
- **Frontend**: A web application for users to submit updates and view summaries. Next.js will be used for the frontend as well as SSR (Server-Side Rendering) capabilities.
- **Chatbot**: A Slack bot that will allow users to submit updates directly through Slack. This bot will interact with the backend API to store and retrieve updates.
- **Backend**: A Python-based API that will handle data processing, storage, and retrieval. Flask will be used to create the API endpoints.
- **Database**: A database to store user submissions, summaries, and any other relevant data. PostgreSQL will be used as the relational database management system (RDBMS).
- **Authentication**: User authentication will be handled using Keycloak to ensure secure access to the application.
- **Deployment**: The application will be containerized using Docker and deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku for scalability and reliability.

## Entities

- **Person**: Represents a user in the system who can submit updates and view summaries.
- **Update**: Represents a daily update submitted by a person.
- **Project**: Represents a project that updates can be associated with. Multiple people may be working on the same project. Each person can submit updates for multiple projects.
- **Summary**: Represents a high-level summary generated from multiple updates. Summaries can be viewed by project or by person.

## Code Structure

The codebase will be structured as follows:

```
